# Intel Integrated Performance Primitives
Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel IPP) is a multi-threaded software library designed to provide developers with a set of high-performance software functions for multimedia processing, data processing, and communications applications. Intel IPP 
functions are highly optimized to take advantage of Intel processors, including various generations of Intel Core, Xeon, and Atom processors. This includes optimizations for different instruction sets like SSE, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512. The library supports
multi-threaded execution, enabling applications to utilize multiple CPU cores efficiently.

The library provides an extensive function set to assist in:
- **Image Processing**: Functions for image manipulation, filtering, and analysis.
- **Signal Processing**: Routines for digital signal processing tasks like filtering, convolution, and Fourier transforms.
- **Data Compression**: Functions for data compression and decompression, including support for popular algorithms like Deflate, GZIP, and LZ88.
- **Cryptography**: Cryptographic functions for data encryption, decryption, and hashing.
- **String Processing**: Functions for string manipulation and text processing.
## Images
### Pixel
Images are made up of pixels. Pixels are the smallest unit of an image (pixel = picture element), representing a single point in the image. Each pixel contains color information that defines its appearance.
### Color Modes
Different color modes are used to represent pixel colors in images. Common color modes are: RGB, Grayscale, or YCbCr.
### Bit Depth
Bit depth refers to the number of bits used to represent the color information of a single pixel. Higher bit depth allows more colors and finer gradients.
### Storage in Memory
Images are stored in memory as contiguous array of pixels. Each row of pixels is stored sequentially, followed by the next row. The stride (or step) is the number of bytes between the start of one row and the start of the next row in memory. Stride can 
include padding bytes added for alignment purposes.
## IPP Concepts
### IPP Initialization
Before using any IPP functions, you need to initialize the IPP library. This step ensures that IPP is correctly configured to use the available processor features.
```cpp
ippInit();
```
### Data Types and Structures
IPP defines several data types and structures that are used frequently
- Ipp8u, Ipp16u, Ipp32u, etc: These are unsigned integer types of 8, 16, and 32 bits, respectively.
- IppiSize: A structure representing the size of an image region of interest (ROI). It has two fields: *width* and *height*.
### Memory Allocation and Management
IPP provides its own memory allocation functions to ensure that the memory is aligned correctly for optimal performance:
- ippsMalloc_8u, ippsFree: Functions for allocating and freeing memory.
```cpp
Ipp8u *pSrc = ippsMalloc_8u(width * height * channels);
ippsFree(pSrc);
```
### Region of Interest
The Region of Interest (ROI) refers to a specific portion of an image that you want to process. Using ROI, you can apply image processing functions to sub-regions of an image without altering the entire image.
- IppiSize: Defines the size of the ROI (width and height).
- IppiPoint: Defines the starting point of the ROI within the image.
```cpp
IppiSize roiSize = {width, height};
IppiPoint roiPoint = {x, y};
```
